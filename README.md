This project's goal is to understand how raw sockets and [ICMP Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) works by implementing a subset of the [`ping`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ping) utility command.

## üì¶ Install

Since creating raw socket need administrator permissions, there's a script that copies the project within a [docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) and bind the host default network interface to it.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you need to install docker, follow [the official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to get started.


If you decide to go the `docker` way, then all you have to do is:

```shell
  $> git clone https://github.com/kibotrel/42-Ping.git ; cd 42-Ping
  $> ./run.sh
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Once everything's done, you'll be inside the container's shell with the project already compiled + access to [`iputils-ping`](https://packages.debian.org/sid/iputils-ping) for reference and [`valgrind`](https://valgrind.org/) if needed for debug purposes.

If you can get administrator permissions on your machine:

```shell
  $> git clone https://github.com/kibotrel/42-Ping.git ; cd 42-Ping
  $> make
```
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Then to use the program either connect as `root` user or use [`sudo`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/sudo) to be able to create raw sockets.

### Usage

This tries to replicate the original `ping` as best as it can within the scope of all the supported features. So basic usage would be the same:

```shell
  $> ./ft_ping <destination>
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Use `./ft_ping -h` to get more information on how to use the program and look into the different supported features.
